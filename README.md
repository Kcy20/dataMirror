<img src="https://image.ibb.co/bEF0B7/doggy.gif" alt="doggy" border="0">

### Details
- Currently, supports drag and drop method only. (Drag a CSV file, directly onto the .exe and it will open that document up) 
- Visual C# (built in Visual Studio 2017)

### Todo list
- [ ] Make it support drag and drop, but also the ability to click the .exe open.
- [ ] A better form design?
- [ ] File button that supports opening a new file.
- [ ] Ability to make changes and add a save/save as button within file button.

### Placeholder

- You can find the .exe inside the obj --> Debug --> Data Mirror 1.0.exe
